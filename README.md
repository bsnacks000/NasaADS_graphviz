### DATA 620
#### Final Project
    
This repo contains files to allow you to locally run a simplified instance of an app that will act as the template on which a final app will be built. The app is meant to allow a user to visualize information about publication patterns in specific domains of astronomy and astrophysics and uses data from the [SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/).
   
####To run the app:
1. clone this repo
2. create a [virtual env](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) in that directory* (super important!)
3. activate the venv 
4. pip install -r requirements.txt to load dependencies
5. python app.py in the top directory will boot the server to localhost:5000
 
\* This proceedure works without error when using Python 2.7.9
